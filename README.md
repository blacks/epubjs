Non-Infusion version of earlier epubReader Component developed as Google Summer of Code 2012 project

Extra features apart from original epubjs includes :-
Currently you can read any epub 2 and 3 text format book file directly from .epub file.
It converts images into data URI form for very chapter.
I have implemented an improve dom traversal for splitting chapter into pages of fixed sizes.
